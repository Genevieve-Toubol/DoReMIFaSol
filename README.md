# carpenteR

carpenteR (cartes peintes en R, standing for Maps drawn using R in French) is a R package mainly aiming at showing off data available on Insee's website (Insee, for the French Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies), helping the user to put them on stage and extract the information they carry. So not only about creating maps (although this is probably one of the most powerful ways of exploring the richness of the data), but using the data without the painful effort to retrieve them on the website, as well as import them into R's memory.
